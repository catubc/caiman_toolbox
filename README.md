# Caiman GUI and Analysis Toolbox

CaImAn GUI and analysis toolbox is an interface for use with the CaImAn software toolbox: https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn

The CaImAn GUI toolbox provided here has a wiki (https://github.com/catubc/caiman_toolbox/wiki) which reviews the use of the GUI and several of the options.

There is also a Youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2SAqQdRTtU) which shows a few of the steps involved in data processing using the GUI and CaImAn.

For bugs, questions, requests and suggestions, please open an issue (see Tab above).
